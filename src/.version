    Mainly work on "TBMigrate 3.5" and supporting changes to "tbutil".
    
    - Addition of "-scope" flag to tbutil's "list entities" commands.
    - Two new tbutil built-in "-s" filter scripts: "@/uuids" and "@/count". The "-s" flag handler now correctly handles this syntax.
    - TBMigrate changes..
      - New field "why" in "groups" table - to facilitate debugging of group creation issues.
      - "collect" script collects details of ALL existing groups from XL - to allow more accurate warnings when name duplicate causes problems.
      - "migrate-targets" now looks for a match on target names using case-insensitve comparision (in an attempt to be more forgiving about the names of pre-migrated targets).
      - "migrate-targets" now checks all target fields common to XL and Classic for existing XL targets and reports on mis-matches, advision the user to correct them before proceeding.
      - Targets of different types but the same name caused problems in 3.4 and earlier - this is now resolved.
      - "migrate-targets" selector marks targets that cant be migrated for reasons of failure or mismatch using a red coloured "Err" flag rather than just an "X".
